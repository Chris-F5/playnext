PLAYNEXT
Play video files in order and remember last watched.

Say I have a number of video files in a folder structure like so:

dir/
  series1/
    episode1.mkv
    episode2.mkv
    episode3.mkv
  series2/
    episode1.mkv
    episode2.mkv
  series3/
    episode1.mkv
    episode2.mkv
    episode3.mkv

I would like to watch each of these in order. So I 'cd' into 'dir/' and run
'playnext'. It plays 'series1/episode1.mkv' then exits ('dir/.playnext' file is
created). Later I decide I want to watch 'series1/episode2.mkv', so I 'cd' into
'dir/' and run 'playnext' - it plays 'series1/episode2.mkv' (and changes
'dir/.playnext'). On each 'playnext' the next episode is played.

OPTIONS
  '-r'  Do not play the next episode, instead play the last one watched.
